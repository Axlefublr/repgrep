An interactive replacer for ripgrep that makes it easy to find and replace across files on the command line.
https://github.com/acheronfail/repgrep

Upon start all command line arguments are passed down to `rg` (adding `--json`).

INTERFACE
---------

There are a few different modes:

* SELECT

  This mode is the first mode presented after `rgr` is started.
  In this mode a list of matches is presented, and they can be toggled on or off.
  Toggling a match off means that the match itself _will not be replaced_.

* REPLACE

  In this mode the user types the desired replacement text and the matches are updated in real-time.
  Note that this is a demo only, no changes are written to disk.
  Pressing enter will cause all selected matches to be replaced with the text entered.

* CONFIRM

  Prompt the user to confirm before writing replacements to disk.

* HELP

  This mode provides a short explanation of the tool and its keybindings.
